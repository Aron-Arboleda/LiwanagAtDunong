                For the volunteers who will come from Manila, the van can
                accommodate only 12 to 14 volunteers. Once you confirm your
                attendance, we will reserve a slot for you.

                Last-minute cancellations hinder us from offering opportunities
                to other volunteers who wish to join. Cancellations made on
                Friday or Saturday are particularly challenging, as potential
                volunteers often assume they cannot join on Sunday and make
                other plans. Consequently, Liwanag at Dunong must cover the
                transportation expenses for the canceled slot. Please note that
                Liwanag at Dunong operates on a very limited budget to sustain
                the weekly learning sessions in the community. We request that
                before committing to join, please make sure that you are all set
                and ready.
