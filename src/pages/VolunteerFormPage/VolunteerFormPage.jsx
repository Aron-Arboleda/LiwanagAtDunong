                  <strong>Where is the community located?</strong>
                </li>
                <p>
                  Our partner-community is in Barangay CutCut II, Capas, Tarlac.

                </li>
                <p>
                  Our volunteers either bring their own transportation, commute,
                  or join us in a van coming from Manila.
                </p>
                <li>
                  <strong>What is the route of the Manila Van?</strong>
                </li>
                <p>
                  We set a meeting place and pick up the volunteers from these
                  points:
                </p>
                <p>
                  LP cityhall - Jollibee Zapote - Baclaran/Heritage - Roxas Blvd
                  - Cityhall/Lawton - Quiapo/Morayta/Espana/UST - Welcome
                  Rotonda - Mayon - A. bonifacio - Cloverleaf Ayala - NLex - San
                  Fernando - Bamban
                </p>
                <li>
                  <strong>Is there any fee to pay to be able to join?</strong>
                </li>
                <p>
                  None, except for those who'd be joining us in the van coming
                  from Manila. Although we deeply wish to cover all expenses for
                  the weekly learning sessions, we are still falling short when
                  it comes to transportation. To rent a van, each volunteer
                  joining will contribute P800, which includes gas, tolls, and
                  food for the driver. However, the option for the volunteer to
                  bring their own transpo or commute is still open.
                </p>
                <li>
                  <strong>I am from Tarlac and I want to join!</strong>
                </li>
                <p>
                  Awesome! We have Team Tarlac who meets every 7:00 am at DCT.
                  They rent their own transpo going to the community and
                  depending on the number of volunteers, they usually contribute
                  P100-P200 for their transpo.

                  For the volunteers who will come from Manila, the van can
                  accommodate only 12 to 14 volunteers. Once you confirm your
                  attendance, we will reserve a slot for you.

                <p className="pageParagP">
                  Last-minute cancellations hinder us from offering
                  opportunities to other volunteers who wish to join.
                  Cancellations made on Friday or Saturday are particularly
                  challenging, as potential volunteers often assume they cannot
                  join on Sunday and make other plans. Consequently, Liwanag at
                  Dunong must cover the transportation expenses for the canceled
                  slot. Please note that Liwanag at Dunong operates on a very
                  limited budget to sustain the weekly learning sessions in the
                  community. We request that before committing to join, please
                  make sure that you are all set and ready.
